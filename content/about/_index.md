PySAL is an open-source project designed to support spatial data science. It released under the [modified BSD license](https://github.com/pysal/pysal/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).

PySAL's development process is fully open, with all official repositories on our
organizational account hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com/pysal). The project
is [governed by a process of consensus](https://github.com/pysal/governance).
Developer meetings are held on the first Friday of the month. Notes of the
meetings are [posted](https://github.com/pysal/pysal/wiki/Developer-meetings).

All interactions between community members are covered by the [PySAL Code of Conduct](https://github.com/pysal/governance/blob/master/conduct/code_of_conduct.rst) which establishes the expectations to build and support an open, collaborative, empathetic and inquisitive environment for community engagement.

## History

PySAL was founded as a collaboration between Serge Rey and Luc Anselin in 2005. The first formal release of PySAL was July 2010 and the project has continued on a six-month release cycle since then. In 2018, PySAL was restructured as a meta-package that brings together a family of packages for spatial data science.
